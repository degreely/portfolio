              <p>
                Our main method of evaluation was user evaluations. We conducted
                usability tests twice: the first round with 4 classmates taking
                the same module; then the second round with 4 potential users.
              </p>
              <p>
                All of our participants are students from the National
                University of Singapore (NUS) with the following key
                characteristics:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Already are planning, or have the intention to plan, their
                  degree progress
                </li>
                <li>
                  Undergraduates from faculties that require students to plan
                  their own modules (i.e. curriculum and syllabus are not
                  pre-determined by the faculty).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The tests required participants to perform a series of critical
                tasks necessary to the success of degree.ly. The nature of these
                tasks will be elaborated on in the later section (Test Tasks).
              </p>
              <p>
                To conduct the user evaluation, we were assigned a participant
                each to facilitate the test for. Tests were conducted remotely
                via the video-conferencing platform, Zoom, and participants were
                required to complete tasks by interacting with our high-fidelity
                prototype on Figma. As facilitators, we had to record our
                observations as participants completed the various tasks we had
                prepared ahead of time. Once the tasks were completed, we asked
                a series of questions for participants to reflect on their
                experience with our prototype, and recorded those responses as
                well.

                          degree planning process is smooth. This is a frequent
                          task as we expect most users to make use of the
                          templates provided.

                          Since degree.ly is a platform for degree planning,
                          adding and removing modules from semesters as part of
                          the planning would be a critical task. This makes
                          performing usability tests for essential. At the same
                          time, we could verify the intuitivity of our design by
                          gauging participantsâ€™ understanding that modules can
                          be dragged and dropped.

                          degree requirements interactions may work but the
